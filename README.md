Implementation of an Ethereum collation (block of a shard) as defined in the [sharding phase 1 spec](https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec/1407) (might be subject to change).

This library is currently IN DEVELOPMENT.

One great way you can help out here is to cleanly identify functionality parts 
that are missing or that would be useful, link to the sources describing the way 
things should work (specification, research discussion,...) and propose a way on 
how to implement this here (as a new issue).

You can also link to an already existing implementation (``Py-EVM`` e.g.) for reference.

Happy sharding! :-)
